# SearchIt!
Onramp/Realtor.com: Pre-Interview Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this application, SearchIt!, is to provide users the opportunity to receive perintent business information in an easily viewable and navigable format. Users will enter the product category, relevant geographical location in (city, state) format, and desired number of results. Through an API call to the Foursquare Places API, the application will decode the JSON data and return a list of locations matching the user specifications. User can click any item in the list for additional information. Additional information presented includes images, name, address, phone number, and menus if applicable. Users will also find a section with recent reviews courtesy of the Yelp API.
