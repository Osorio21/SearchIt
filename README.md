Onramp/Realtor.com: Pre-Interview Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this application, SearchIt!, is to provide users the opportunity to retrieve perintent business information in an easily viewable and navigable format. Users will enter the product category, relevant geographical location, desired number of results, and sorting parameters. Through an API call to the Foursquare Places API, the application will decode the JSON data and return a number of locations in a table matching the user specifications. User can click any item in the table for additional information. Additional information presented includes images, name, address, phone number, and tips if applicable.
