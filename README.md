# SearchIt!
Onramp/Realtor.com: Pre-Interview Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this application, SearchIt!, is to provide users the opportunity to retrieve perintent business information in an easily viewable and navigable format. Users will enter the product category, relevant geographical location, desired number of results, and sorting parameters. Through an API call to the Foursquare Places API, the application will decode the JSON data and return a number of locations in a table matching the user specifications. User can click any item in the table for additional information. Additional information presented includes images, name, address, phone number, and tips if applicable.

## Architectural Design Pattern

### MVC Architecture

MVC design pattern assigns objects in an application a role as a model, view or controller. Roles, however, can be merged allowing an object to fulfill two roles such as a view controller or a model controller. This pattern defines the purpose of an object in the application and the ways it communicates with other parts of the applciation. Software that adheres to this pattern generally is scalable, maintainable, well-defined and testable.
